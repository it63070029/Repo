                         Hummingbirds get their name from sound their wings make, which can flap up to 80 times a second. Apart from their small size, one way to identify hummingbirds is by their bright iridescent colors on their throat and chest. Hummingbirds also have long skinny beaks that allow them to get nectar from plants. Most species of hummingbird migrate from North America south to Mexico and Central America.</p>
